# Miscellaneous
1. *#google-chrome-installer#* : Installing chrome on kali can be a real pain sometimes, or it's just too difficult for some. I have, therefore, created a script that will directly install it without any hassles, hopefully. Link of the original post is provided in the script.  
2. *dynamicLink.sh* : A simple demonstration of dynamically linking a library in C, without using -l command.  
3. *libre-office-installer* : A script to directly install libre-office for your linux system. Works for Ubuntu/Mint/Kali.
